### Hi there ğŸ‘‹,

I am currently building a headless design system for [Roadpass Digital][roadpasslink]. 

- ğŸ”¥ Working on ~redacted for now~.
- ğŸ”­ Thinking about what the next generation of design tools, and mentoring looks like.
- ğŸ’¬ Talk to me about design, design systems, Figma, or sci-fi von Neumann probes over a Zoom Coffee.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: [Twitter][twitterlink] would work the best right now.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
